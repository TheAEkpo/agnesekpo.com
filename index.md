# About

<img src="/assets/images/about.jpg" alt="Agnes Ekpo" style="float: right; width: 400px; border-radius: 20px; margin-left: 20px;">

Hello, I am Agnes. A data analyst with a background in pharmacy and a passion for making insight-driven decisions possible. I work with businesses, nonprofits, and health organizations to help them translate their data into meaningful action.

Whether it’s improving operational efficiency, optimizing reporting workflows, or uncovering key performance trends, I bring structure and clarity to complex data challenges.

I’ve delivered projects across healthcare, finance, tech, and the social sector, combining strategic thinking with hands-on analytics to solve real problems.  

My toolset includes **Python**, **SQL**, **Power BI**, and **Excel**, but what truly sets my work apart is how I connect the dots between data and people.

I focus on actionable insights, building systems teams trust, telling better stories with data, and grounding solutions in both the numbers and the human context.
