# About

<img src="/assets/images/about.jpg" alt="Agnes Ekpo" style="float: right; width: 500px; border-radius: 20px; margin-left: 20px;">

Hello, I am Agnes. A data analyst with a background in pharmacy and a passion for making insight-driven decisions possible. I work with businesses, nonprofits, and health organizations to help them translate their data into meaningful action.

Whether it’s improving operational efficiency, optimizing reporting workflows, or uncovering key performance trends, I bring structure and clarity to complex data challenges.

I’ve delivered projects across healthcare, finance, tech, and the social sector, combining strategic thinking with hands-on analytics to solve real problems.  

My toolset includes **Python**, **SQL**, **Power BI**, and **Excel**, but what truly sets my work apart is how I connect the dots between data and people.

I focus on actionable insights, building systems teams trust, telling better stories with data, and grounding solutions in both the numbers and the human context.  If you're thinking about your next data project and want someone who understands both the analytics and the business side, I’d love to hear from you.
