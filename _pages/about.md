Hi, I’m Agnes, a data and analytics consultant with a background in pharmacy and a passion for making insight-driven decisions possible. I work with businesses, nonprofits, and health organizations to help them translate their data into meaningful action. Whether it’s improving operational efficiency, optimizing reporting workflows, or uncovering key performance trends, I bring structure and clarity to complex data challenges. <br><br>

I’ve delivered projects across healthcare, finance, tech, and the social sector; combining strategic thinking with hands-on analytics to solve real problems. My approach is grounded, thoughtful, and human. I focus on what works, not just what’s flashy. My toolset includes Python, SQL, Power BI, and Excel but what truly sets my work apart is how I connect the dots between data and people. I’m here to help teams work smarter, tell better stories with data, and build systems they can trust.  </div>

If you’re thinking about your next data project and want someone who understands both the numbers and the context, I’d love to hear from you.
