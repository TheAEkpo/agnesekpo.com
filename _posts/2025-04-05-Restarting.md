excerpt: "Leaving the familiar behind, learning new tools, and rediscovering myself through data. Here's where I am and where I'm going."

Over the past few months, I’ve been rebuilding from the ground up: professionally, geographically, and creatively.

In late 2024, I made the life-changing move from the UK to Canada, carrying nothing but my determination, a few suitcases, and a deep belief that something better was possible, and with that move came something else: the decision to *restart* my data science journey with new eyes, a broader vision, and a clearer sense of purpose.

One of the most exciting things I've done recently is building this website from scratch — hosted on GitHub Pages, styled with Jekyll, and slowly molded into something that feels like... me. It wasn’t easy. There were errors, broken layouts, and full evenings lost in Stack Overflow threads. But that’s the beauty of learning. It’s messy, satisfying, and wildly empowering.

At the same time, I’m deepening my skills through hands-on projects and collaborations. I joined the ALX Africa Data Science program, which challenges me to think not just like a coder but like a problem solver, using data as a language for change. One of the assignments tasked us with building our website, portfolio and personal brand.

### Oh, Canada!

Migration forces reinvention. Canada isn’t just a new home, it’s a new stage, a new rhythm, and a chance to create space for the things I genuinely want: meaningful work, intellectual growth, and creative freedom. The "job market" ( this phrase makes me laugh, and I seriously don't know why) is intense. It's been nearly four months, and I am wondering what I am not doing right and trying to improve and evolve.

I’m embracing the discomfort of the unfamiliar. I’m saying yes to things I once feared. And I’m documenting it all — not because I have it figured out, but because this is what building a life in tech *actually* looks like.

### What’s Ahead

I’ll be sharing more soon: reflections, project walkthroughs, data experiments, maybe even a few hard-earned lessons from building a personal brand from scratch... and outside of data science, my interests: travel, tv, and food.

If you're reading this, thank you for being here. If you're also restarting, know this: *You’re not alone, and you’re not behind. You’re building.*

One skill, one line of code, one brave move at a time.
